1. Contents

This package includes three ART implementations as follows:

  o ipArt: supports arbitrary address length and arbitrary
    stride length distribution. `ipArt' uses simple multibit
    trie.
  o ipArt-PC supports arbitrary address length and arbitrary
    stride length distribution. `ipArt-PC' uses path-compressed
    trie.

`ipArt' and `ipArt-PC' are in the same binary. You can choose
which one is used when instantiating a routing table.

3. Installation

Type `make' to make a test command rtLoookup.


4. Interactive Simulation

  - IPv4 simple trie:          ./rtLookup 4 simple 
  - IPv4 path-compressed trie: ./rtLookup 4 pc
  - IPv6 simple trie:          ./rtLookup 6 simple 
  - IPv6 path-compressed trie: ./rtLookup 6 pc


5. Data Structures

5.1. rtTable: Routing Table

`rtTable' is used to represent a routing table. It is not
necessary for users to access the members of `rtTable'.


5.2. routeEnt: Route Entry

The definition of `routeEnt' in `ipArt' and `ipArt-PC' is as
follows:

  typedef struct routeEnt {
      u8  dest[16];               /* upto IPv6 */
      int plen;                   /* prefix length */
    int level;                  /* for performance */
  } routeEnt, *pRouteEnt;

`dest' must represent the destination address of the route.
`plen' must represent the corresponding prefix length.
The destination address must be stored in the network byte
order.


6. API functions

6.1. Routing Table Creation

rtTable *
rtArtInit (int nLevels, s8* psl, int alen, trieType type)

 @name  rtArtInit

 @brief API Function.
        Creates and initializes a routing table.
        Example usage:
          - IPv4 routing table
          - The stride lengths are:
             level 0: 16 bits
             level 1:  8 bits
             level 2:  8 bits
          - Use a path-compressed trie

         s8      sl[3] = { 16, 8, 8 };
         rtTable pt    = rtArtInit(3, sl, 32, pathCompTrie)

 @param[in] nLevels The number of trie node levels
                    (or the number of stride lengths)
 @param[in] psl     Pointer to an array of stride lengths
 @param[in] alen    Bit length of IP addresses (32 or 128)
 @param[in] type    simpleTrie (0) or pathCompTrie (1).

 @retval rtTable* Pointer to the allocated routing table
 @retval NULL     Failed to allocate a new routing table

Hereafter, let the routing table pointer be:

  rtTable*  pt;   /* Pointer to the routing table */


6.2. Insertion

routeEnt*
pt->insert(rtTable pt, routeEnt* pEnt)

 @brief  API function.
         Add a route represented by `pEnt' to the routing table `pt'

 @param[in] pt   Pointer to the routing table
 @param[in] pEnt Pointer to the route added to `pt'.
                 `pEnt' must NOT point to a local variable.

 @retval routeEnt* `pEnt' is successfully inserted.
         pEnt      There is an existing route that has the same
                   IP prefix (address and prefix length).
                   `pEnt' must be freed in this case.


6.3. Deletion

bool
pt->delete(rtTable pt, u8* dest, int plen)

 @brief  API function.
         Deletes a route represented by an IP prefix (
         (address and its prefix length) from the routing table.
         The matched route entry is freed in this function.

 @param[in] pt    Pointer to the routing table
 @param[in] pDest Pointer to the IP address to be deleted from `pt'
 @param[in] plen  Prefix length associated with `pDest'

 @retval ture  If the matching route is deleted from `pt'.
               The route entry is freed in this function.
 @retval false If there is no matching route in `pt'.


6.4. Longest Prefix Match

routeEnt*
pt->findMatch(rtTable* pt, u8* pDest)

 @brief  API function.
         Perform the longest prefix match.

 @param[in] pt          Pointer to the routing table
 @param[in] pDest       Pointer to the destination IP address

 @retval routeEnt* Pointer to the longest prefix matching route.
 @retval NULL      There was no matching route for `pDest'


6.5. Exact Route Match

routeEnt *
pt->findExactMatch(rtTable* pt, u8* pDest, int plen)

 @brief API Function.
        Performs the exact match (address + prefix length.)

 @param[in] pt    Pointer to the routing table
 @param[in] pDest Pointer to the IP address to be searched for
 @param[in] plen  prefix length of `pDest'

 @retval routeEnt* Pointer to the found route entry (success)
 @retval NULL      Failed to find a matching route entry
