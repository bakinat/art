1. Contents

This package includes three ART implementations as follows:

  o ipArt: supports arbitrary address length and arbitrary
    stride length distribution. `ipArt' uses simple multibit
    trie.
  o ipArt-PC supports arbitrary address length and arbitrary
    stride length distribution. `ipArt-PC' uses path-compressed
    trie.

`ipArt' and `ipArt-PC' are in the same binary. You can choose
which one is used when instantiating a routing table.

Type `./rtLookup 4 simple' or `./rtLookup 4 pc' and a menu shows
up.
